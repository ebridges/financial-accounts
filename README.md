# Accounting System

## 1. Overview and Objectives
This is a double entry accounting system that provides a robust personal finance tracking and reconciliation application. Users can track transactions across multiple accounts, import data from financial institutions, match preexisting transactions in a configurable way, categorize expenses, and perform periodic reconciliations against bank statements. The design draws on double-entry accounting principles—ensuring data consistency, clarity of debits/credits, and the ability to generate meaningful financial reports.

### Key Objectives
1. **Data Integrity**
    - Use **double-entry** style transactions and splits.
    - Enforce referential integrity using foreign keys.
    - Prevent common data errors (e.g., mis-matched books for transaction vs. account).
2. **Easy Reconciliation**
    - Mark transactions as _cleared_ or _reconciled_ within the system.
    - Provide a mechanism (triggers and foreign keys) to avoid mismatched or duplicated data.
3. **Flexibility and Extensibility**
    - The schema uses **UUID** primary keys, making it easier to merge or migrate data.
    - The system can be adapted to different database backends (e.g., migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL).
4. **Hierarchical Accounts**
    - Support **parent-child** relationships among accounts (e.g., grouping categories under top-level accounts).
    - Allow organizing expense and income categories in a tree-like structure.
5. **Reporting**
    - The schema supports queries and pivoting on **accounts**, **transactions**, and **splits**, essential for generating income/expense statements or custom reports.

## 3. System design goals

- The application stores data in a relational datamodel identified by a DB URL provided as an argument.
- Implemented with a service based architecture supporting web and CLI user interfaces.
- Ability to scale to hundreds of thousands of transactions per month.
- Support a basic set of accounting reports (balances, expenses, periodic trends) as well as adhoc queries.
